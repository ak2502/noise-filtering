## Noise Filtering

We are using 3 algorithms to perform noise filtering on test_noise.wav audio file which contains some background noise.

The algorithms used are:-
1) Time Domain - Moving Average Filter (moving_average.py)
2) Frequency Domain Filter (freq_filter.py)
3) Spectral Subtraction (spectral_subtraction.py)
